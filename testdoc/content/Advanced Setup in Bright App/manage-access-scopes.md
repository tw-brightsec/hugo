For some Bright operations and integrations, you will need specific scanning and management permissions provided by selecting the relative access scopes. For example, to enable integration with your CI pipeline, you may require to create an organization or a personal API key with a predefined set of scopes. Each scope grants the permission to perform a certain action, such as create, run, view, edit, or delete a particular Bright component. 

There are three cases when you can select access scopes:
* [Creating an organization API key](/docs/organization-api-key-scopes)
* [Creating a project API key](/docs/project-api-key-scopes)
* [Creating a personal API key](/docs/personal-api-key-scopes)
* [Management of userâ€™s role](/docs/role-management-scopes)
