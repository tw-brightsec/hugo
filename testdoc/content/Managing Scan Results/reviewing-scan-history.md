Scan history shows the history of runs of a specific scan, including future scheduled runs. Each run is displayed as a separate scan in the **Scans** table and may have different statuses and results. Reviewing the details of each run may provide insights in to the trends of findings and scanning results for your organization. 

You can select all runs (history) of a specific scan from the **Scans** table automatically using the **History ID**. 

To review a scan history, follow these steps:

1. Copy the **History ID** of the scan you want to review.
