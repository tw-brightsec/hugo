## Setting date and time

All your activity in the Bright app, scan runs and details are time-bound. That is why to ensure proper management of the activity log and scans history, you need to verify the date and time settings.  

The current date and time are shown at the top of the **DATE SETTINGS** section. To change the time and date formats, follow these steps:

1. From the **Time Zone** dropdown list, select your time zone.
2. From the **Date Format** dropdown list,  select the format for date indication. 
3. Select the first day of the week and the time format using the relative buttons.

## Setting your notification preferences

You can define the events related to a certain object type that will be posted in your feed (activity log). Bright also allows you to select the types of events you will be notified about via email as well as to deny some specific warnings. 

To enable or disable such event notifications, you simply need to select or clear the relative check boxes in the **FEED SETTINGS**, **EMAIL NOTIFICATION SETTINGS** and **CONSENTS** sections. After you complete the selection, click **Save**.

## Managing your personal API keys (authentication tokens)

To enable some Bright operations and integrations, you will need an authentication token (API key). You can either create an API key in the **Organization** tab or on your **User Settings** page. Below is a short video instruction on how to create both organization-level and personal API keys.

 To create a personal API key, follow these steps:

1. Enter you personal settings page. For that, click <img src="https://files.readme.io/518ba3f-user-button.png" width="23" height="23"> in the upper-right corner of the **Scans** page, and then select **User Settings**.
2. In the **MANAGE YOUR USER API KEYS** section, click **+ Create API key**.

        1894
      ],
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]



2. Assign the API key a name, select which access scopes to allow it and which type of actions (such as read or write) it is permitted to perform. Read more about the access scopes [here](/docs/manage-access-scopes).

3. Click **Create**.

   On the popup, copy the generated key and save it to a safe place since as soon as you navigate away from this popup, you will not be able to restore this key.  
   The created keys without the entire values are listed in the **MANAGE YOUR API KEYS** section.
