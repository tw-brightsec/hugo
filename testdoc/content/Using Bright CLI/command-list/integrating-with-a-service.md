This command that connects Bright with a ticketing service deployed on a local server (currently only the On-Premise Jira is supported): `nexploit-cli integration [options]`. The repositories of the connected service can then be integrated with the Bright projects to be used as endpoints for scan reports (details of detected security vulnerabilities).

For more information about the integration capabilities, see [Ticketing Integrations](/docs/integrate-nexploit-with-your-ticketing-system).

**Script Example**

```shell
nexploit-cli integration --access-key $INTEGRATION_ACCESS_KEY --base-url https://your-cluster.atlassian.net --user $USERNAME --password $PASSWORD --token $API_TOKEN
```



> ðŸ“˜ Notes
> 
> - Sample variables are marked with a `$`. You must substitute them for your real values.
> - If your Jira username or password includes any special characters (for example, "pa$$word"), enclose the entire username or password in single quotes.
