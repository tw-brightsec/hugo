      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]



4. _(For owners and admins)_. Assign a role to the group.  
   The assigned role defines the access scopes the group will be granted. You can either select a default or a custom role. To learn how to create a custom role, see [Manage Custom Roles](https://docs.neuralegion.com/docs/manage-custom-roles). 
5. In the **MEMBERS** section, select the users to be added to the group. 
6. In the upper-right corner, click **Create**.

## Changing group configuration

To change the group configuration, follow these steps:

1. In the **GROUPS** section, select the group the configuration of which you want to change.
