This guide is designed for organizations and development teams that want to make security scanning an integral part of their Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using the Bright CLI.

If you want to get more information about the Bright CLI purpose and features, see [About Bright CLI](/docs/about-nexploit-cli).

You can integrate Bright with your CI pipeline to automatically run a scan on every new build made to your application or API. Both scanning of a publicly-exposed target and a target in a private environment are available. 

Introducing Bright as part of your SDLC features the following advantages:
* Increasing delivery speed
* High security level
* Easy to use for developers
* Multiple integration options

Please see our guide on [integrating Bright with CI pipelines](/docs/integrate-nexploit-with-your-ci-pipeline) for more information.
