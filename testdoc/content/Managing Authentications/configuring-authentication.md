## The Logout Indicators tab

This section contains the options to be used during the application scanning to determine if the authentication flow is no longer valid and the authenticated resources cannot be reached. The options define how the application responds in case the authentication flow fails.

| **Response status**     | Select the checkbox and then enter the HTTP response status that will tell you about the authentication failure.                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Header pattern**      | Select the checkbox and then enter the header name and Regex pattern that will help you identify the authentication failure. For example, you can use a simple Regex pattern, such as `index`.                                                                        |
| **Bode pattern**        | Select the checkbox and then enter the body pattern that will help you identify the authentication failure. For example, this Regex pattern detects a body looking for a UUID in a `sessionId` parameter: `sessionId: \"\\b(uuid:){0,1}\\s_([a-f0-9\\-]_){1}\\s\*\".` |
| **Page pattern**        | Select the checkbox and then specify CSS selector(s) or inner text selector(s) that match page element(s) to be used as logout indicator(s).                                                                                                                          |
| **Request URL pattern** | Select the checkbox and then enter the URL pattern that will help you identify the authentication failure.                                                                                                                                                            |

# Testing authentication

Preliminary authentication testing helps you verify if the authentication object has been configured correctly. This allows you to reveal the configuration issues timely, before running a scan.

To test your authentication object, at the bottom of the **Create authentication** dialog, click **Test authentication**.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/42d44d2-e30ce0b-test-auth.png",
        "e30ce0b-test-auth.png",
        1560
      ],
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]



The application displays the test results in a separate **Test results** tab. 

- A valid authentication object returns three success messages indicated in the relevant  **Test results** sections: 
  - **Test Authentication Triggers** provides the test request and response data.
  - **Authentication call (fillForm #)** provides a screenshot of the form filled by the engine per stage.
  - **Authentication call (submitForm #)** provides a screenshot of the authenticated page as evidence of the successful login.
  - **Authentication call (Check Post-Login URL)** provides a screenshot of the post-login URL as evidence of the successful login.
  - **Access Protected Resource** provides the test request and response data.

In this case, you can save the configured object and add it to your scans.

- If the test results include a failure message, go back to the object configurations and verify their correctness. Use the test request/response data to find a certain failure and fix it.

> The Bright engine only supports the `set-cookie` headers that are less than 4097 bytes. If the received header exceeds this limit, the engine will ignore the header and will not include it in the request/response data.  Breaking the limit may also cause authentication object failure.
