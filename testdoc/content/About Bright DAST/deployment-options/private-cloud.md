## Overview

Unlike the standard SaaS offering that uses a multi-tenant architecture for the databases and static network configurations, the Private Cloud provides a completely separate, configurable cloud environment for your organization.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> The private cloud instance is hosted on the Bright infrastructure.

The Private Cloudâ€™s separate, non-multi-tenant environment offers the following benefits over a standard SaaS environment: 

- Separate databases at the instance level. Standard SaaS only accommodates some databases at a logical level.
- Full control over network-level configurations, such as:
  - Load handling.
  - Network-level access configurations (IP allow/deny).
  - Options for site-to-site VPN setup.
- Improved security in lateral-movement scenarios.

## How the private cloud deployment works

All relevant components, which may include sensitive information, such as databases, engines and so on, are deployed in a separate cloud instance that is managed by Bright. 

## Deployment platforms

Currently, the Private Cloud is deployed on AWS. Deployment to other cloud vendors can be added, as needed. Bright fully manages the deployment process for you.
