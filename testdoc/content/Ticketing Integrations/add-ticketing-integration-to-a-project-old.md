2. In the **Projects Integration Config** dialog box, do the following:

- In the **Project field**, enter or select the Bright project that you want to use for the scan.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> You can start a scan only if a project is selected. If you do not have any projects in the Bright app, select the **Default** one.

- From the **Associate repositoryâ€¦** dropdown list, select the repository (project, channel) that you want to use for the scan results within the specified project.  
  The selected repository is automatically added to the **REPOSITORIES** list below. You can add multiple repositories (boards) to this list.
  - To arrange the associated repositories in alphabetical order, hover-over **Name** and click <img src="https://files.readme.io/34858fa-down-arrow.png" width="23" height="26"> next to it. 
  - To make the repositories order free again, hover-over **Name** and click <img src="https://files.readme.io/66a5f7c-up-arrow.png" width="23" height="26"> next to it. 
  - To delete a repository from the list, click <img src="https://files.readme.io/60c9313-dots-button.png" width="23" height="26"> next to the repository and select **Disassociate**.
  - To quickly select the required repository from the list, use the **Find a repository** search field. 
  - To select the number of associated repositories that you can view on one **REPOSITORIES** page, use the **Items per page** dropdown list.
  - To switch between the **REPOSITORIES** pages, use the navigation buttons above **Close**.

3. Once you complete the projects integration configuration, click **Close** at the bottom of the dialog box.  
   The associated repositories will be displayed in the **TICKETING SETTINGS** section on the **Project Settings** page.

### Filtering the severity level of issues to be opened in the integrated services

You can select a certain severity level of issues (findings) to be sent to a repository/channel associated with your  Bright project. For example, if you set the high severity level for the GitHub integration, then only the detected issues of high severity will be displayed in your GitHub repository. 

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> The option to filter issue severity is only available to the users whose roles include the `integrations.repos:manage` access scope. For more information, see [Manage Access Scopes](/docs/manage-access-scopes).

1. In the left pane, select **Projects**.
2. Click <img src="https://files.readme.io/60c9313-dots-button.png" width="23" height="26"> next to the project which is integrated with the required ticketing service, and then select **Settings**.
3. In the **TICKETING SETTINGS** section, use the **Issue severity** dropdown menu to filter the issues that will be sent to the associated repository.
