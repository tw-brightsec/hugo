Target Authorization enables you to scan targets directly from the Bright cloud. 

It is mandatory to use target authorization if you intend to use scanning from the Bright cloud. There are several ways of authorization a target:

- Connect [the Repeater](https://docs.brightsec.com/docs/on-premises-repeater-local-agent): 
- Add [.nex file](https://docs.brightsec.com/docs/manage-your-organization#defining-the-hosts-authorized-for-scanning): file used to authorize the target (site, application, and so on) and prove that it is ready to be scanned directly from the Bright app. See [Defining the Hosts Authorized for Scanning page](https://docs.brightsec.com/docs/manage-your-organization#defining-the-hosts-authorized-for-scanning) to learn more.
- If you are an enterprise customer please reach out to [support@brightsec.com](mailto:support@brightsec.com) in order to resolve the issue
