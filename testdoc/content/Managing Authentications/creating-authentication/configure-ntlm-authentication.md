If the target network uses the NTLM protocol to verify the userâ€™s access rights, you need to set up an NTLM authentication object. The protocol requires a user to be authenticated by providing a username and a corresponding password. After the userâ€™s log-in credentials are recognized, the network can then check access rights and allow the user to enter. 

Therefore, you can grant  Bright access to an NTLM authenticated network you are going to use for a scan by providing your credentials, workstation name, and the network domain. 

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> This topic describes only how to fill in fields specific for NTLM authentication (the **Setup** tab). For general steps, see [Creating Authentication](https://docs.brightsec.com/docs/configuring-authentication).

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Before following the instructions below, ensure that your application and authenticated resources are accessible to the Bright engine, either directly from the Internet or via the Repeater.

From the **Authentication type** dropdown list, select **NTLM authentication**, and then proceed to the authentication details.
