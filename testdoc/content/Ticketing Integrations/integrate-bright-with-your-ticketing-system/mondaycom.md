Any changes on the NeuraLegion App side are disabled.<br></br>  You simply need to add the app to your board to enable the integration configuration. Each ticket with an issue report will include the following information:\n      <ul>\n        <li>Issue severity level</li>\n        <li>Details of discovery</li>\n        <li>Possible exposure</li>\n        <li>Remediation suggestions </li>\n</ul>\n    </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr><td></td></tr>\n</table>\n</body>"

The NeuraLegion integration app allows you to integrate different <b>monday.com</b> boards with different NeuraLegion projects. This means that the results of the scan run under a particular project will be provided on a separate board. 

## Prerequisites

- You are an active user in the [NeuraLegion App](https://app.neuralegion.com). 

## Step-by-step guide

### Connect your monday.com domain to Bright organization

To enable the integration, you need to connect your NeuraLegion organization to your **monday.com** domain first: 

1. Go to the NeuraLegion App.
2. In the left pane, select **Organization**. 
3. On the **Organization** page, scroll down to the **TICKET MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION** section.
4. Click <img src="https://files.readme.io/60c9313-dots-button.png" width="23" height="26"> next to **monday.com**, and then select **Settings**.

        1898
      ],
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]



5. In the dialog box, enter your **monday.com** domain and click **Connect**.  
   You are redirected to the **monday.com** marketplace. You need to close the marketplace window, since the integration is configured for a specific board. 

### Integrate your monday.com board with Bright

1. From the **Workspaces**, select the board that you want to integrate with NeuraLegion.
2. In the board header, click **Integrate**.

        1908
      ],
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]



3. From the apps list, select the **NeuraLegion integration** app and add it to your board.

        1815
      ],
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]



4. On the **monday.com** web page,  click **Authorize**.

  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/3dd8129-monday-authorize.png",

        1920
      ],
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]



5. Set the recipe according to which the tickets for detected issues will be created on the board.  
   The **item** configuration allows you to adjust the default board columns based on the issue information. For example, you can set a severity level to be displayed in a separate column, or next to the issue title in the **Title** column.  The recommended board setup is the following:
   - Set **Name** to **Title** to create a separate column for an issue title.
   - Set **Status** to **Severity** to create a separate column for an issue severity level.
   - Set **Item Update** to **CWE ID**, **ID**, **CVSS**, **Description**, and **Remedy** to get a complete issue report as a comment to the issue item. You can customize this field by excluding the information that might be redundant for you.

        1804
      ],
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]



6. Click **Done**, and then click **Add to board**.  
   The integration is enabled. This is also indicated in the **TICKET MANAGEMENT INTEGRATION** section in the NeuraLegion App.

        1899
      ],
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]



 Now you can run a scan from the NeuraLegion App under the selected project and check the detected issues on the integrated board.
