> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> Please make sure the XPath/CSS selector is very specific, that is only one element matches the XPath/CSS selector. Otherwise, it will negatively affect scan results.
> 
> To check if the XPath/CSS selector is specific, you can use the search option in your browser DevTools. 
> 
> 1. Open the **Elements** tab and press** Ctrl + F**/**Cmd âŒ˜ + F** (the steps may differ for some browsers). 
> 2. In the search field, enter the XPath/CCS selector you specified for the scan.  
>    In the upper-right corner of the search field, you will find the number of elements defined by the XPath/CCS selector. No elements or more than 1 element indicate that the XPath/CCS selector is invalid or non-specific respectively.
> 
> To check the number of elements defined by the XPath, you can also use a special script.  
> In the DevTools, open the **Console** tab and execute the script below. Substitute **${desired_xpath}** with the XPath specified for the scan. No elements or more than 1 element indicate that the XPath is invalid or non-specific respectively.
