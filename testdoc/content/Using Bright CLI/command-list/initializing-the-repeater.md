This command initializes the Repeater mode: `nexploit-cli repeater [options]`. When a scan is run in the Repeater mode, all the scan requests are pulled from the cloud through a Repeater (scan proxy) to the local target of the scan.

The Repeater mode enables you to run the Bright scans on a local compiled application, without exposing your ports externally. This means that you can scan an application without having to deploy it or to generate external reports.

The Repeater mode is based on the Bright CLI version. If you have already connected a Repeater, you cannot connect the same Repeater (with the same ID) with a different CLI version. In this case, you first need to install the latest version of the Bright CLI and then proceed to the connection. 

For more details about the Repeater mode, see [Repeater (Scan Proxy)](/docs/on-premises-repeater-local-agent).

**Additional Features**:

- Enables multiple scans to run through a single Repeater.
- Option to add headers to requests locally (for example, authentication cookie), without exposing them to the cloud.

> üöß Important
> 
> The Repeater mode requires a working `AUTH_TOKEN` with the scope `repeaters:write`.
