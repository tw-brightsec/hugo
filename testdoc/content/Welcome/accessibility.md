## High-contrast themes

The Bright app meets the contrast requirements of WCAG 2.0 to allow people with low vision to use the app fully. The contrast is adapted for both light and dark themes.

## Fully keyboard input

Bright supports full-fledged keyboard control of the application without using the mouse. The control is carried out through a focus element, which can be moved over all page elements. To start using this mode, you need to select any element using the keyboard by pressing **TAB**. The following keys are used to control the focus element:

- **TAB** - Selection of the next element
- **Arrows** - Changing the parameters of the selected element
- **ENTER** - Confirmation of the adjustment 
- **ESC** - Closing the pop-up window and returning to the main page
