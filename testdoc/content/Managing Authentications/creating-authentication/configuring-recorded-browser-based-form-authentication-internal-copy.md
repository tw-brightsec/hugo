- **Recorded browser-based form authentication** is a quick and visual way of creating authentication flows. It allows uploading an authentication flow which was prerecorded with the Chrome recorder and using it as authentication with Bright.

## Recording an authentication flow

To record a session using Google Chrome Recorder, follow the steps below.

1. In the Chrome browser, open the target URL in a separate tab.
2. Open DevTools.

> ðŸ“˜ Note
> 
> **Opening DevTools**
> 
> - In Chrome's main menu: Click the three dots menu (**Customize and control Google Chrome**) and then select **More Tools** **Developer Tools**.
>   - On Windows: Press **Ctrl+Shift+J**.
>   - On Mac: **Ctrl+Option+J**.
