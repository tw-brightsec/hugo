Retesting at issue creates a separate scan entity that is a duplicate of the selected scan. Initially, the settings are identical, but you can modify them without affecting the original scan settings. A separate [scan history](/docs/reviewing-scan-history) is maintained for each retested scan.

### Step-by-step guide

1. In the left pane, select the **Scans** option to display the scans List. 
2. Click <img src="https://files.readme.io/a74f9a9-dots-button.png" width="23" height="26"> next to the scan to be retested.
3. From the dropdown list, select **Retest**.

4. In the **RETEST SCAN** dialog box, check and, if necessary, modify the scan settings, and then click **Retest scan**.  
   Depending on the settings, the scan will be run immediately or will be scheduled for later.
