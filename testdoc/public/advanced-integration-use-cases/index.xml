      <description>The Bright webhooks allow you to integrate with any third-party system you need and automatically send a .JSON file containing the scan information, triggered by specific scan events. Using the webhooks will keep you notified about critical changes that happen during the scanning process, with no need to manually check the results of multiple scans daily. You will also be able to detect a failed scan and fix it quickly.</description>

      <description>You can configure your CI/CD pipeline to automatically run a Bright scan on every new build and check if a detected issue (vulnerability) is newly occurring or repeated. If the issue is new, Bright will send the details to Jira to open a corresponding issue ticket.
To integrate your CI/CD pipeline with Bright to automatically run a scan on every new build, see Integrate Bright with Your CI Pipeline.
In this section, you will find the instructions on how to configure a script to check if a detected issue was found previously and only send new issues to Jira.</description>
