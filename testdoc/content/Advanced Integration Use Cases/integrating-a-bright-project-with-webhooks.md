The Bright webhooks allow you to integrate with any third-party system you need and automatically send a .JSON file containing the scan information, triggered by specific scan events. Using the webhooks will keep you notified about critical changes that happen during the scanning process, with no need to manually check the results of multiple scans daily. You will also be able to detect a failed scan and fix it quickly.  

Currently, the Bright webhooks will be triggered and sent on any scan status changes (but more advanced triggers are planned), for example, from ‚ÄúRunning‚Äù to ‚ÄúDisrupted‚Äù, or from ‚ÄúRunning‚Äù to ‚ÄúDone‚Äù. The .JSON file will contain the scan details, including the initial configuration, start time, issues detected so far, and will be sent to a preferred API endpoint, either directly or via the Repeater. 

To configure the integration, you need to create a webhook for the project under which you are going to run your scans. The created webhook will be automatically triggered for all the scans run under this project.

## Creating a webhook

To create a webhook, follow these steps:

1. In the left pane, select **Projects**.

{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/0f0cab9-projects.png",
        "projects.png",
        1902
      ],
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]



2. In the **MY PROJECTS** table, select the project for which you want to configure the webhook integration. 
3. In the upper-left corner of the project page, click <img src="https://files.readme.io/47150dc-settings-icon.png" width="23" height="23"> to open the project settings, and then scroll down to the **WEBHOOKS** section.

{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/58ec041-project-settings.png",
        "project-settings.png",
        1897
      ],
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]



4. Click **Create webhook**.  
   If you already have webhooks, the button name will be **+Add webhook**.

5. In the **Details** tab, do the following:  
   a. In the **Webhook name** field, enter a name for the webhook.  
   b. _(Optional)_. In the **Description** field, enter a short description for the webhook, for example, what distinguishes this webhook from others.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/381d551-create-webhook.png",
        "create-webhook.png",
        1892
      ],
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]



6. Open the **Configuration** tab and do the following:  
   a. From the **Repeater** dropdown list, select the repeater that you want to be used during sending a .JSON file to a preferred API endpoint. 

> üìò Note
> 
> Make sure that the selected repeater is connected via the Bright CLI. See [Managing Repeater](https://docs.brightsec.com/docs/manage-repeaters) for more information.

   ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†b. Select an HTTP method and enter the endpoint URL to which a .JSON file should be sent.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/63b0738-configuration.png",
        "configuration.png",
        1570
      ],
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]



7. Click **Create**.  
   The webhook is automatically activated and displayed in the **Webhooks** table on the **Project settings** page. For all scans run under this project, Bright will send a .JSON file to the specified URL whenever a scan status changes. 

> üëç Tip
> 
> All the webhook request/response details are also recorded to the .JSON file. You can review them to make sure that there were no critical problems when triggering the webhook. Additionally, you can also run the Repeater used for this webhook in the verbose mode, to create visibility and monitor the whole process in the real time.

## Deactivating a webhook

All created webhooks are available in the **Webhooks** table on the **Project Settings** page. Once a webhook is created, it is activated by default. You can temporarily disable notifications on a scan status change by deactivating the webhook.  
To deactivate a webhook, follow these steps:

1. On the **Project settings** page,  scroll down to the **Webhooks** table. 
2. Click <img src="https://files.readme.io/60c9313-dots-button.png" width="22" height="24"> next to the webhook you want to deactivate, and then select **Deactivate**.

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/2b6abf2-deactivate.png",
        "deactivate.png",
        1547
      ],
      "sizing": "80"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]



The webhook status will become ‚Äúdeactivated‚Äù, and the **Deactivate** option in the menu will change to **Activate**, so that you can activate the webhook back whenever it is required. 

## Editing a webhook

You can edit webhook details and configuration whenever you want. To edit a webhook, follow these steps: 

1. On the **Project settings** page,  scroll down to the **Webhooks** table. 
2. Click <img src="https://files.readme.io/60c9313-dots-button.png" width="22" height="24"> next to the webhook you want to edit, and then select **Edit**.
